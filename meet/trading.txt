Trading

ep#1

	⁃	Your needs per month x 6 = emergency fund (sort of)
	⁃	80% investment, 20% trading of remaining money after expenses.
	⁃	Fundamental vs technical analysis 
	⁃	Trading is an intent to sell while investing is not.
	⁃	Demand and supply
	⁃	Eg. Big funds do not place whole order at once once they find a fundamentally strong company to invest in. They order over a period of time during which the stock price raises continuously.
	⁃	Herd mentality
	⁃	Book mention : madness of market by mackasey
	⁃	Trading systems just mentioned 


ep#2

	⁃	Systematic vs discretionary/scalp trading
	⁃	Your gut cannot be always right
	⁃	Trading systems : success rate should be >50%
	-	back testing
	-	We will create trading systems but We first need to learn tools for doing so ie. technical analysis


ep#3

	- Technical Analysis
	- History tends to repeat itself
		- eg. Ac is cheap in winter and expesive in summer. it is repeated every year
	
	- There are 3 types of trends
	- greed and fear manifests itself over long tern in 3 trends - bull, bear

		- uptrend
			- higher low
		- sideway
			- confusion
		- downtrend
			- lower highs
	
	- Markets discount everything
		- when any news comes, the market already is reflecting it (in price)

		- so, don't follow the news, follow the price.
	
	- How is more important than why

	- Technical analysis is a study of price and patterns to gauge demand and supply, it analyses the past and doesn't predict the future.


	- Types of price charts

		- Line chart
		- Candlestic basics
		
	- Candlestick patterns

		Single Candelstick Pattern
		- Hammer

			- It indicates more demand, and if this happens in top 50 companies(with huge turnover), then it is not just a bunch of retail investors, it indicates institutional money coming in!

			- when a pattern emerges in longer time frame, there is probably a lot of money behind it.

			- It doesn't work all the time

		- Inverted Hammer
		- Marubozu
		- Doji

		Multiple Candelstick Pattern
		- Engulfing (bullish)
		- Bearish Engulfing
		- Bullish Harami
		- Morning star

	
	- point : price don't follow the news, news follow the price

	- minute/hourly charts don't make sense, daily is good, weekly is even better 

	- This was all on seeing just a candle or a group of candles.


ep#4

	- Technical Analysis-Chart Patterns and Price Action

	- Support and Resistance
		- you  need 2 points to draw it.

	- Effect of round numbers on psychology

	- This should be on weekly/monthly chart

	- Polarity, breakout and breakdown

	- Double top and double bottom patterns
		- Continuation patterns
		- Reversal patterns : M & W

		- Now these are just one/two of many patterns avilable

	- Now, all this is not quantified, it is discritionary, So, this is where indicators comes into play


ep#5

	- 


I am currently a student trying to explore as much fields as possible through my interest in technology, reading, business and investment.

Strength :  Interest in reading and learning through various means, quick learner, team player.

Weakness : Still confused about it!


Android - 7
Java - 8
Flutter - 6
HTML, CSS - 8
JS - 5
Dart - 6
C/C++ - 8


Yes I often solve practice questions on Hackerrank.

Also I got Best Coder SVIT, 2019 in college level coding competition - Cyclone


I currently want to invest my time and energy in learning as much as I can in my field as well as other fields to take exposure and make the best choices I can in my life path

I want to join Jeavio as an Software Engineer(Associate) because I presume that I will be able to learn so much form the experienced software engineers working at Jeavio.

Creating software/apps is a form of creativity for me. And it may sound like work to others but for me it is like playing or any other form of creative work(like painting) and I just love it.

And thus I think I am definitely suitable for this post.
