.not a single notification
.uninstall all non required apps, no social apps (just think again)
.dont let google track you nor any other platform or use alternatives qwank/duckduckgo
.never see recommended video on youtube
.chrome extension to remove recommendation
.fact check every thing you consume (just like checking ingredients and details of cookies you eat)
.	and consider source
.never click on clickbait, it is voting machine collecting votes

.get different kinds of information (eg. follow opposite people on twitter to get completly different viewpoint/angle)

.notice that in tech industry many/most of people dont give this devices to their own children

.think : in series one's child dont use social media at all, Its a rule
	really no screen time for their children

.3 rules of one of the person in web series:
.	1. leave phones at 8.30 pm out of bed rooms (half hour before bed)
.	2. no social media until 16 years of age
.	3. time budget

problems:

information overload
unneeded information at wrong time
youtube overload
twitter tumor
mxplayer and similar things including extreme

my specific steps:

no social apps on phone accept whatsapp that too with muted notifications of all groups
whenever required use things on laptop in a specific time

avoid all type of feed (twitter feed & trending, instagram, youtube recommendations)

use firefox may be always in incognito mode
in browser install extensions to stop distractions

stop google and other sites from tracking you


The idea is that it is a tool as use it according to you whenever required, dont let it consume you
